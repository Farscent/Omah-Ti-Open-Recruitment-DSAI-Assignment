# Salary Prediction

The open recruitment process was divided into two parts; Theory test, and practical test.

In the practical test, participants were given salaries of different job titles (mainly in the technology sector). 
The task was to develop a model to predict the total gross annual salary of employees across different job roles, experience levels, employment types, and geographic locations. 
Using historical salary data and relevant job attributes, the model should provide accurate salary predictions, accounting for different work arrangements, company sizes, and levels of experience.

My submission notebook is contained in the .zip file. 
I obtained pretty decent results of RMSE scores;
- 60121.02226 RMSE (30% of the test data)
- 62334.06200 (70% of the test data)
showing good consistency, but slight overfitting and future improvements are there.
